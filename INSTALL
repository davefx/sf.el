The instalation of sf.el is very simple.

1. Open the .emacs configuration file in your favorite editor (emacs???) 

2. Add the path of the sf.el, example:
   (if (file-exists-p "~/.emacs.d/sf.el")
    (load-file "~/.emacs.d/sf.el"))

3. Add the path of the Symfony2 project. example:

   (setq SFPath "~/SF2Instalation/")

4. Reload emacs o reload the .emacs file with the load-file command.

Thats is all

You can view the atual functions of the library in HOWTO doc in the repository.
